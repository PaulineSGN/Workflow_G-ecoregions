# Implementation of a Galaxy workflow for the ecoregionalization of the Dumont D'Urville sea.

**Abstract :**

Antarctica is a unique continent, characterised by peculiar geographical, climatic, biological, and geopolitical conditions. The Southern Ocean that surrounds it plays a central role in the ecological balance of the region. This fragile ecosystem is crucial to the survival of many species, and the establishment of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) contributes to its conservation. This internship report presents the development of a Galaxy analytical workflow for the eco-regionalisation of the Dumont d'Urville Sea, a crucial area for the conservation of Antarctic marine biodiversity. Using biological occurrence data collected during the CEAMARC campaign, the workflow aims to produce species distribution maps and identify eco-regions within the study area. The objective of this project is to provide accessible, reproducible, and transparent IT solutions for processing and analysing species occurrence data. The implementation of this workflow in the Galaxy platform will foster the application of FAIR principles to analyses and provide technical support for MPA proposals in East Antarctica. 

**Key words:** Galaxy, Antarctica, FAIR, Workflow, Eco-regionalization.
